My name is Rahmadani Najwa Alfriza, commonly known as Najwa (나즈와). I am 20 years old. I came from Surabaya, East Java, Indonesia. In my home university, Politeknik Elektronika Negeri Surabaya, I am studying about Telecommunication Engineering (which study about electrical infrastructure and program systems).

I have interests about content-creating in Instagram and designing. About the websites, actually I ever try to make an Interface Design in Figma for a websites and I enjoyed it.

I choose this course in Ulsan College because i want to know more what's going on behind the websites for every requests (command, like when we clicked it, we directed onto other page, and other). And also want to develop my knowledge in websites before making my own websites in the future.
